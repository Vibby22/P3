Test Plan:
- started with tokenizing the input that came through from our loop
- implemented built in commands like pwd, cd, which, and exit (Ex: cd subdir, exit: Byebye!)
- used execv() to start programs
- made a test batch file to test batch mode ( ./mysh batch.sh)
- we implemented wildcards, pipes, and redirection, making sure to test multiple commands for each.
- Examples:
  - cat < input.txt
  - ls *.txt
  - ls i*t
  - echo "Hello" > output.txt
- We did some basic error handling
- we tried to handle edge cases such as invalid files, nonexistent commands, and empty input
- not sure if this is how its supposed to work but ls* prints everything, not just in my P3 directory, but in the Downloads directory, the one previous.
